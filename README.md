# ADXL372 Accelerometer Driver
Arduino Library for ADXL372. This code implements the spi of the ADXL372 accelerometer via hardware and software.

# About the ADXL372
The ADXL372 is a digital accelerometer that supports both SPI and I2C mode and 'range' of 200g. The Adafruit_ADXL345 driver takes advantage of I2C mode to reduce the total pin count required to use the sensor.

More information on the ADXL345 can be found in the datasheet: https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL372.pdf
